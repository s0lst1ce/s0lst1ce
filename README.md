Hello there! I'm a student undetaking furhter education in science and I love anything related to astrophysics 🪐. Though when I'm not looking up some physics phenomenon I enjoy coding 🖥️. This Github account is meant as a collection of my learning projects. With every project I try something new, be it the language, the tooling or the designs used! If you stumble upon something you like feel free to contribute or star it 🌟.
